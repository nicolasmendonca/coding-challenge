# Readme

Two things worth mentioning:
- "Most recent" sort: products dont have a `created_at` timestamp to be sorted, so i just sorted the `products._id` alphabetically.
- API comes with a `history` model to be requested, but the design does not seem to require me to use it, so I didn't.

# Additional notes

If you click on the user's coins indicator, you can add +1000 points to keep spending, so you can test things around.

P.D.: A Jedi master might offer you to make a choice. But it's never too late to regret it...
